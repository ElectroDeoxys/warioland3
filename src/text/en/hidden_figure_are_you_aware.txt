A hidden@figure:



Are you aware,  
Wario ? 


This world is in
the music box 


you were peering
into. 


I was the god
that protected
this world. 

But one day,
a wicked being
sealed away my 

power, and took 
control of this
world. 

Wario, 



I want you to
find the 5 music
boxes needed to

break the hidden
seal and recover
my powers. 

If you find
them, I'll send
you back to 

your own world. 



Of course,
all the treasure
you find is 

yours to keep! 



Will you help
me ?
