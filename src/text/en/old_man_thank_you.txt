Old Man:



Thank you very
much !!


Long ago, this
was a peaceful
world.

But
that meddlesome
being appeared

and tried to
take control.


We managed to
seal away his
power

in the 5 music
boxes,


but he used the
last of his
power

to change us
into strange
beings.

Fearing his
return, we tried
to stop you,

but we never th-
ought you would
defeat him !

Thank you very
much.


So, we give you
all the treasure


you have
collected so
far.

Now then, let me
send you back to
your own world.
